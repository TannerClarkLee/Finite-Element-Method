README:
For operation, use either the FEM_Boundariesincluded or FEM_Boundariesexlcuded.   Let your u' be the func.m and u be your gunc.m. You will use gunc.m for error analysis later.  The purpose of this entire code is to predict the gunc.m.  If error analysis is not an issue, remove that portion from the code.
For further explination on the numerical components, see the finite_element-methods.pdf
